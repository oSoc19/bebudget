# Be Budget

In 2017, the Belgian government spent 229.0 billion euros, 134.7 billion of which were received in taxes. But how did the government choose to allocate it?

Before oSoc 2019, the data on government spending was available to view by anyone, but its format made it completely inaccessible to the average citizen. Therefore, our small team decided to take it upon ourselves and build an app that will allow every Belgian taxpayer to view how their contributions to the state are used every year.

Within four weeks, we built an app that offers two main features:

1. It tests your existing knowledge on the way the Belgian government chooses to spend its income using a 5 question quiz. 
2. It provides you with a visual, interactive representation of how the money is allocated.
